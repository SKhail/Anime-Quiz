# Anime-Quiz

## Description

The focus on this challenge is to build a quiz which I created a Anime type of Quiz that will include multiple choice questions that will have the ability to store high scores.

## Challenge Face / Solution

This challenge enabled me to elevate my skills by intoducing topics I hadn't encountered. Such as: managing the timer function to halt and procees when 10 seonds is deducted, transfering my quiz questions from on Javascript file to another and effectively dealling with local storage that presented some complexities that demanded the use of documentations and videos.

In addtion to this one area which may not be relating to this challened bu coding for long period of times can lead to silly mistakes therefore in future for a better strategic approach will try doing them in time blocks.

## Improvements

Due to time contraint wasn't able to add cool feature although in future will potentially implement sound effects and display messages when a user answers the wrong question.
